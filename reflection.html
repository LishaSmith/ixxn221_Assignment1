        <h1 class="blogTitle">Wireframing</h1>
        <p class="blogDetails">I thought up a very basic wireframe. Originally I liked the gradient, but when
            I created my site I found it looked a bit tacky. I opted for this cool green toned blog instead. But the colour palette is still undecided. I really liked how the cards looked that Blaine made so I swapped my concept of a really long white box for multiple cards. I still kept the two simple buttons aswell as the basic home page.

        <h1 class="blogTitle">Mini Assignment One</h1>
        <p class="blogDetails">In this Assignment we used the Inspect Element tool to help us in recreating a basic site. I had a hard time choosing a site, I ended up deciding on the Apple website. Which I thought would be quite simple. It was not.
            Inspect Element did not help at all, there were a lot of different divs and I had no idea what anything meant. I did manage to find the font as well
            as some of the images Apple used. But a lot of it was guesswork.
