        <p class="blogDetails">Whilst Georgia and Christine have been finishing up their code, I've started making a presentation for our website using Canva. I've written out content for our: Purpose, Users, Design Decisions and Start-to-end Flow.<br>
             I have also set up a Google Doc where we can put more detailed accounts for these things. I transferred what I had written in the presentation over to the Doc, and also put in some screenshots from the Figma.<br> I feel that we are really on track.</p>

        <p class="blogDetails"> On Tuesday Georgia created the Github repo and I committed the master with the files. I linked all the pages together. As a group we decided on tasks we were going to do.<br>
            I took on the role of coding the landing page, probably the easiest part, and then I'd join another member and we can code together.<br>
            Today I coded the landing page, both desktop and mobile version. I did have trouble getting the logo to float left of the text, so I have arranged it as such for now, my teammates are okay with this.

We also had a design critique which gave us some great feedback aswell. Which we are going to work on. We are still yet to create a mobile version, but we all agreed to create a page each.

            <p class="blogDetails">I have been updating the layout of my blog, using various tutorials which I will link. I wanted a Tumblr type of layout that had a lot more information as opposed to just one column.
                Creating a responsive grid layout was very difficult for me and pushed me to expand my coding knowledge. I had to figure out how to use Plug-ins, and while I'm still learning, I am quite happy that I even managed to follow the tutorial correctly.<br>
                Another feature I added was a slideshow aspect, this saved space on my posts and also the code is easily reusable. I did have problems adding in additional slideshows, but I found that was to do with the JavaScript.<br>

            <h1 class="blogTitle">Wireframing</h1>
            <p class="blogDetails">I thought up a very basic wireframe. Originally I liked the gradient, but when I created my site I found it looked a bit tacky. I opted for this cool green-toned blog instead. But the colour palette is still undecided. I liked how the cards looked that Blaine made so I swapped my concept of a long white box for multiple cards. I still kept the two simple buttons as well as the basic home page.</p>

            <h1 class="blogTitle">Why Git is Useful for Designers</h1>
            <p class="blogDetails"> Git is one of the most popular version controls systems. Git allows each team member to branch off of the master code and work on the same code individually. Each developer gets their own local repository with the full history of commits which allows quick access to all previous version of the files.<br>
                The way Git is designed allows for an easy keeping of changes, as each branch requires permission before it can merge with another, this also allows for a discussion that ensures only the best work is integrated.<br>
                As a developer goes along in their coding process, they commit their changes to their branch making note of what changes are being saved. This can then be merged with the master branch if the code is approved.<br>
                Git is good for designers since it is very easy to have multiple people work on the same code at the same time, and you are able to do this without affecting code existing code since you can roll-back to previous versions at any time.

            <h1 class="blogTitle">Mini Assignment One</h1>
            <p class="blogDetails">In this Assignment, we used the Inspect Element tool to help us in recreating a basic site. <br>
                I had a hard time choosing a site, I ended up deciding on the Apple website. Which I thought would be quite simple. It was not. 
                Inspect Element did not help at all, there were a lot of different divs and I had no idea what anything meant. I did manage to find the font as well as some of the images Apple used. But a lot of it was guesswork. I had to search quite a while for some of the CSS but this website was way out of my skill zone.<br>
