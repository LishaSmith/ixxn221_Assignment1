        <h1 class="blogTitle">Wireframing</h1>
        <p class="blogDetails">I thought up a very basic wireframe. Originally I liked the gradient, but when
            I created my site I found it looked a bit tacky. I opted for this cool green toned blog instead. But the colour palette is still undecided. I really liked how the cards looked that Blaine made so I swapped my concept of a really long white box for multiple cards. I still kept the two simple buttons aswell as the basic home page.

        <h1 class="blogTitle">Why Git is Useful for Designers</h1>
        <p class="blogDetails">Git is one of the most popular version controls systems. Git allows each team member to branch off of the master code and work on the same code individually. Each developer gets their own local repository with the full history of commits which allows quick access to all previous version of the files.<br>
            The way Git is designed allows for easy keeping of changes, as each branch requires permission before it can merge with another, this also allows for discussion that ensures only the best work is integrated.<br>
            As a developer goes along in their coding process, they commit their changes to their branch making note of what changes are being saved. This can then be merged with the master branch if the code is approved.<br>
            Git is good for designers since its very easy to have multiple people work on the same code at the same time, and you are able to do this without affecting code existing code since you can roll-back to previous versions at any time.

        <h1 class="blogTitle">Mini Assignment One</h1>
        <p class="blogDetails">In this Assignment we used the Inspect Element tool to help us in recreating a basic site. <br>
            I had a hard time choosing a site, I ended up deciding on the Apple website. Which I thought would be quite simple. It was not. 
            Inspect Element did not help at all, there were a lot of different divs and I had no idea what anything meant. I did manage to find the font as well
            as some of the images Apple used. But a lot of it was guesswork. I had to search quite a while for some of the css but this website was way out of my skill zone.
